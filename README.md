# üß† Deep Learning Projects Showcase

Welcome to my Deep Learning project collection!  
This repository gathers a set of hands-on projects exploring various machine learning and deep learning architectures.

## üîç Highlights

- üìÇ Projects include applications in Image Classification, Object Detection, and Medical Image Segmentation.
- üí° Architectures used: CNN, Vision Transformers (ViT), UNet, SwinUNETR, and more.
- ‚ö° Execution-ready notebooks available and tested on **[Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/bkhedi)** for smooth and resource-friendly runs.
